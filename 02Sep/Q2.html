<!-- Comments in HTML are used to add explanations, notes, or descriptions within the
code that are not visible to the user when the webpage is rendered in a browser.
They are meant for developers or anyone reading the code to understand its
structure, purpose, or to leave reminders for future modifications.

Purpose of Comments in HTML: Documentation: Comments help document the code,
explaining its functionality, structure, or any specific considerations.

Clarity and Understanding: They improve code readability, making it easier for
other developers to comprehend the codebase.

Temporary Deactivation: Comments can temporarily disable or exclude code without
deleting it, useful for testing or debugging.

How to Use Comments in HTML: In HTML, comments are created using the <!--
Comment Text Here --> syntax. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Sample HTML Page</title>

<!-- This is a comment in HTML -->
<h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
